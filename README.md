# CheeseHawk - A Personal Tab-Tracking Application
This project is an application intended to be a tab-tracking app for friends and acuaintences. It uses EFCore to interface with Sqlite as a console application. You can input usernames and phone numbers and track a rolling tab ammount for them. I had grander ideas for it but time got the better of me I suppose.

Features it includes:
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
- Make your application asynchronous
- Query your database using a raw SQL query, not EF

  There are no special instructions for running it, though it does target a Windows environment.
